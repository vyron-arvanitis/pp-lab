**Programming**

1. Transformer
2. *Paul*: GCN - Linear layer investigation?
3. Make sure all the plots have labels
4. Clean up the save models
5. dataset_and_models notebook from main branch
6. *Vyron*: Make loading_and_evaluation.ipynb work - Issues with transformer
7. *Vyron*: Evaluate ROC and speedup of optimal model 
8. *Angelos*: Finish optimal model investigation, Delete class function normalize_inputs from optimal model

Every result should be reproducable!

**Report**

1. Write theory about transformer and MLP (emanuele?)
2. Find a logical order of listing in methodology
3. Methodology: Moritz, Angelos, Emanuele investigations update
4. Results: Take every result from the methodology part and combine it into a perfect model
5. Results: Table with every model, where training, test, and validation acc and ROC and Speedup is summarized
6. Conclusion: conclude
7. Appendix for code snippets?
8. Need to mention that for the results we used the whole dataset!
