\section{Results}

For the final results we evaluated our models on a new test dataset (i.e.
a dataset not used throught the training process) and used the following
models:

\begin{itemize}
    \item deepset 
    \item deepset combined
    \item deepset gcn
    \item deepset combined wwith gcn
    \item transformer
    \item deepset combined wwith gcn normalized
\end{itemize}
